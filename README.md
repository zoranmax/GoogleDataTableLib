## Project Description

This library enables the end users to create a lightweight representation of the google.visualization.DataTable object directly in Microsoft.NET and obtain the necessary JSON as needed by the Google Chart Tools Javascript library.

The approach used in this project was to create a lightweight object model that is fast and that consumes few resources.

It is perfect for server side applications hosted on ASP.NET or ASP.NET MVC or any other Microsoft.NET framework. 

It is based and compiled on v .NET 3.5 in order to give pretty much a good compatibility with older kind of projects still running on this frameworks.
