## Project Description

This library enables the end users to create a lightweight representation of the google.visualization.DataTable object directly in Microsoft.NET and obtain the necessary JSON as needed by the Google Chart Tools Javascript library.

The approach used in this project was to create a lightweight object model that is fast and that consumes few resources.

It is perfect for server side applications hosted on ASP.NET or ASP.NET MVC or any other Microsoft.NET framework. 

It is based and compiled on v .NET 3.5 in order to give pretty much a good compatibility with older kind of projects still running on this frameworks.

## Contact me
Currently trying to build a list of sites using the Google DataTable .NET Wrapper library. If you want to share your experience using the library or if you want that a link to your site to appear here, please [contact me](http://www.zoran.me) 

## Version 4.1.0.0 is now published:
For more information please check the following location
https://www.nuget.org/packages/Google.DataTable.Net.Wrapper/4.1.0

Out of the new features there is a new flag being added which allows the library to escape the '' and '"' characters.
This can be done by using the  

```
  DataTable.EnableJsonStringEscaping; 
```
which by default it is set to **false** un order to be backward compatible.

Bit thanks go to https://github.com/sjasperse for implementing this feature!
